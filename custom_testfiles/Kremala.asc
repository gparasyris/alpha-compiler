/*
	Here is a simple version of 
	a classic game. Word is the 
	hidden word you are trying to
	gues. Printed is a table same
	size as word, which contains
	the letter you have found.
	Printed is initialized with
	"_".

	At the start of the game you
	are asked to give the number
	of wrong answers you are given.

	Input must be a sigle character 
	letter. 

	The game ends when you have
	guesed the word or you have
	overcome the wrong answers
	given at the start of the game.
